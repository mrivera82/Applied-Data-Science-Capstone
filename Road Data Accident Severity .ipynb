The large number of people means of transport and different climatic or circumstantial factors have made traffic accidents a part of everyday life around the world.\n\u00a0The patterns involved in dangerous crashes and road accidents can be helpful in developing road safety policies or greater awareness of the driver himself. The study of these patterns, causes and severity of injuries can predict the severity or probability of an accident, which would be very useful for the well-being of any driver, offering the possibility that, knowing the risks and probabilities of an accident, drive with more care. or even change your trip. Undoubtedly, this would help all drivers to have a better perspective of possible accidents, the most dangerous routes, the less favorable weather conditions and with all these data make a more informed decision.\n"
